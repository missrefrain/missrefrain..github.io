    <p class="lead">Welcome to Miss Refrain. The following Terms and Conditions govern the relationship between Miss Refrain (hereinafter "Miss") and the users and customers of its telemedia Services (hereinafter "User"). They define the conditions under which the use of the Services offered by "Miss Refrain" takes place.</p>

    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-decoration-underline">1. Acceptance of the Contract Concerning the General Terms and Conditions</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>By creating an Miss Refrain account or by using the Miss Refrain app, whether with a mobile device, a mobile application or a computer (collectively, the "Service"), the User agrees to the following Terms of Use.
            Miss may make changes to this Agreement and the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in laws or regulations, new functions, or changes in business practices. The most current version is always the valid version. If the changes include significant changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will provide you with reasonable notice of those changes, by way of messages via the Service or by e-mail, for example. If you continue to use the Service after the changes take effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-decoration-underline">2. Access</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>Access to the Miss database and Services is granted after the User has registered. During registration, a password and pseudonym specified by the User is used. Registration requires the User to enter an e-mail address and completely fill in the registration form.<br>
            As an alternative, the User is offered a connect function from third-party providers (e.g. Facebook Connect). When registering via the connect function of a third-party provider, the respective profiles of the User are transferred to the Miss database. When registering via the connect function of a third-party provider, the User must accept the respective terms and conditions of the third-party provider.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-decoration-underline">3. Scope of Services</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>Miss allows users to access a central database system via its mobile application. This database system contains profiles and information about other users. After registering and creating their own profile, users have the option to search for other profiles in the database. Users can view the profiles of other users and contact them. In addition, Miss offers the possibility of accessing data material (for example in the form of live webcams) from selected users and webcam performers as part of access to the database system. The content, type and duration of the data material provided and transmitted by the respective user/performer shall be the sole responsibility of the user/performer.<br>
            Miss provides both free and paid services. With free registration, a user can create a profile, view the profiles of other users and read messages from other users. Likewise, a user can mark the profiles of other users free of charge. If two users mark each other's profiles, this is displayed to both users. This represents a so-called match.<br>
            The user will be informed about the costs, the content and the scope of the services as well as the price and the terms of payment before these services are provided.<br>
            Miss may use externally commissioned service providers to offer its telemedia services. These include, in particular, payment providers and content providers. Commissioned external service providers who provide services on behalf of Miss shall not be considered third parties within the meaning of these General Terms and Conditions.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-decoration-underline">4. Authorisation</dt>

        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>Minors and persons acting on behalf of a third party are excluded from using Miss's Services. If Miss has reason to suspect that a person is not entitled to participate, Miss shall be entitled to verify the person's personal data by validating their identity by requesting official documents. Users who are not entitled to participate are excluded from using Miss's Services and the database.</p>

            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>By creating an account and by using the Service, the User declares and guarantees that:</li>

            <p>
                Miss always strives to improve the Service and provide Users with additional functionalities that they find appealing and useful. This means that from time to time Miss will introduce new product features or enhancements and remove some features, and if these measures do not materially affect the rights or obligations of Users, Miss may do so without prior notice to Users. Miss may even suspend the Service altogether, in which case Miss will notify Users in advance unless mitigating circumstances, such as security concerns, prevent this.

        <dt class="col-sm-3 text-decoration-underline">7. Purchases</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>
                In addition to the free Services, Miss offers the User various fee-based Services and benefits. With each individual use of these Services, the User enters a new contractual relationship with Miss. Each use of a Service constitutes a new contractual relationship. These Services are completely detached from the free use of the Miss database system. The individual contracts do not constitute subscriptions. The contract is concluded by the User selecting the chargeable Service and accepting the payment obligation by pressing the "Confrim Booking" button (hereinafter: Order Process). The Services subject to charges are also subject to local terms and conditions.

In addition, Miss Refrain is authorised to charge the selected payment provider (the User's "payment method"). Miss Refrain may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if payment has already been requested or received.

However, Miss will review each request on a case-by-case basis and has the right to make refunds only as a gesture of goodwill and without acknowledging any legal obligation.<br>
                        In general, all fees for purchases are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods/servicesa.<br>
