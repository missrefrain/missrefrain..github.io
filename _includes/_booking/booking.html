    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1> 

<div class="mb-1 text-body-secondary">Last edited on 21.06.2021</div>

<p>Welcome to Miss Refrain. The following Terms and Conditions govern the relationship between Miss Refrain (hereinafter "Miss") and the users and customers of its telemedia Services (hereinafter "User"). They define the conditions under which the use of the Services offered by "Miss Refrain" takes place.</p>

1. Acceptance of the Contract Concerning the General Terms and Conditions
By creating an Miss Refrain account or by using the Miss Refrain app, whether with a mobile device, a mobile application or a computer (collectively, the "Service"), the User agrees to the following Terms of Use.
Miss may make changes to this Agreement and the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in laws or regulations, new functions, or changes in business practices. The most current version is always the valid version. If the changes include significant changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will provide you with reasonable notice of those changes, by way of messages via the Service or by e-mail, for example. If you continue to use the Service after the changes take effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.
2. Access
Access to the Miss database and Services is granted after the User has registered. During registration, a password and pseudonym specified by the User is used. Registration requires the User to enter an e-mail address and completely fill in the registration form.
As an alternative, the User is offered a connect function from third-party providers (e.g. Facebook Connect). When registering via the connect function of a third-party provider, the respective profiles of the User are transferred to the Miss database. When registering via the connect function of a third-party provider, the User must accept the respective terms and conditions of the third-party provider.
3. Scope of Services
Miss allows users to access a central database system via its mobile application. This database system contains profiles and information about other users. After registering and creating their own profile, users have the option to search for other profiles in the database. Users can view the profiles of other users and contact them. In addition, Miss offers the possibility of accessing data material (for example in the form of live webcams) from selected users and webcam performers as part of access to the database system. The content, type and duration of the data material provided and transmitted by the respective user/performer shall be the sole responsibility of the user/performer.
Miss provides both free and paid services. With free registration, a user can create a profile, view the profiles of other users and read messages from other users. Likewise, a user can mark the profiles of other users free of charge. If two users mark each other's profiles, this is displayed to both users. This represents a so-called match.
For a fee, in addition to the free services listed above, the user is offered to contact other users and write messages to them. The live webcam offers are also subject to a charge. Here the user can use offers to chat erotically with real women, to watch/see them live via cam stream and to communicate - there are no limits to the erotic fantasy. The user will be informed about the costs, the content and the scope of the services as well as the price and the terms of payment before these services are provided.
Miss may use externally commissioned service providers to offer its telemedia services. These include, in particular, payment providers and content providers. Commissioned external service providers who provide services on behalf of Miss shall not be considered third parties within the meaning of these General Terms and Conditions.
4. Authorisation
Minors and persons acting on behalf of a third party are excluded from using Miss's Services. If Miss has reason to suspect that a person is not entitled to participate, Miss shall be entitled to verify the person's personal data by validating their identity by requesting official documents. Users who are not entitled to participate are excluded from using Miss's Services and the database.
By creating an account and by using the Service, the User declares and guarantees that:
•	they can enter into a binding contract with Miss;
•	they will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations; and
•	they have never committed a serious crime or a punishable act (or a similar offence), a sexual crime or a violent offence and is not listed as a sex offender in any state, federal or local sexual offender register.
5. Termination of the Free Membership
a.	A user is entitled at any time to delete his profile without giving reasons.
b.	In addition, Miss reserves the right to refuse the registration of a User at any time without stating reasons
c.	If the User violates these General Terms and Conditions, Miss may terminate the membership at any time without notice
d.	Upon termination of membership, all obligations of the operator to store data of the User cease, unless statutory retention periods require storage.
6. Modification of the Services
Miss always strives to improve the Service and provide Users with additional functionalities that they find appealing and useful. This means that from time to time Miss will introduce new product features or enhancements and remove some features, and if these measures do not materially affect the rights or obligations of Users, Miss may do so without prior notice to Users. Miss may even suspend the Service altogether, in which case Miss will notify Users in advance unless mitigating circumstances, such as security concerns, prevent this.
7. Purchases
In addition to the free Services, Miss offers the User various fee-based Services and benefits. With each individual use of these Services, the User enters a new contractual relationship with Miss. Each use of a Service constitutes a new contractual relationship. These Services are completely detached from the free use of the Miss database system. The individual contracts do not constitute subscriptions. The contract is concluded by the User selecting the chargeable Service and accepting the payment obligation by pressing the "Buy" button (hereinafter: Order Process). The Services subject to charges are also subject to local terms and conditions.
a.	Miss Refrain Purchases
If the User chooses to make a purchase through Miss Refrain, they agree to pay Miss Refrain all fees at the indicated price for the Services they have selected, as well as any costs or taxes that may be incurred on their payments. In addition, Miss Refrain is authorised to charge the selected payment provider (the User's "payment method"). Miss Refrain may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if payment has already been requested or received. If the User reverses a transaction or otherwise reverses a payment via its payment method, Miss may, at its sole discretion, immediately delete the User account.
b.	„Coins“
By concluding a paid contractual relationship, the user is credited with an amount selected in the ordering process in the form of a credit account. The credit balance is kept in so-called "Coins". Against a consumption of 50 "Coins" the user can send messages to other users. Against a consumption of 100 coins, the user can use the live webcam offer by the minute. If the credit account has no more "Coins", the sending of messages and the consumption of the Live Webcam offer is no longer possible. Through the order process, through which a new purchase contract is concluded in each case, the user can add "Coins" to his credit account again.
c.	Virtual Items
The "Coins" are virtual items that the User acquires.
The User is only permitted to purchase virtual items via Miss and by no other means. Virtual items form a limited license subject to this Agreement. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, virtual items purchased by the User will be licensed to the User and the User acknowledges that no title or ownership of the virtual items will be transferred or assigned to the User. This Agreement shall not be construed as a sale of rights of virtual items. No account balance in the User's account with respect to the virtual items represents a real-world account balance or reflects any stored values but represents a measure of the scope of the User's license. There are no fees for virtual items if they are not used, but the license granted to the User for virtual items ends, in accordance with the terms of this contract, if Miss ceases to provide the Service or if the User's account is otherwise closed or terminated. Miss reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge fees for the right to access or use virtual items and/or may distribute virtual items for a fee or free of charge. Miss can manage, regulate, control, modify or remove virtual items at any time. If Miss exercises any of these rights, Miss shall not be liable to the User or to third parties. The transfer of virtual items is prohibited, and the User may not sell, accept back or otherwise transfer virtual items to any natural or legal person. Virtual items can only be taken back via the Service. All purchases and returns of virtual items made through the Service are final and non-refundable. The provision of virtual items for use within the Service, is a Service provided by Miss that begins immediately upon the User's acceptance of the purchase of such virtual items.
d.	Refund
User acknowledges that Miss is under no obligation to refund for any reason and will not be entitled to any money or other compensation for unused virtual items if an account is closed, whether intentional or unintentional. However, Miss will review each request on a case-by-case basis and has the right to make refunds only as a gesture of goodwill and without acknowledging any legal obligation.
In general, all fees for purchases are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
Purchases of virtual items are final and non-refundable.
8. Terms of Payment
a.	The fee for paid Services must be paid in advance to Miss and is collected in full by the payment method selected in the Order Process, such as credit card, direct debit, online banking, Paysafe Card or PayPal. After successfully completing the Order Process, the coins will be credited to the customer account immediately, but at the latest after 2 hours. When purchasing by credit card, Miss Refrain will appear as a descriptor on your statement.
b.	Miss may have the payments for fee-based Services processed by an external Service provider appointed by Miss.
9. User Obligations
a.	The User is solely responsible for the content of their registration, further personal data and thus for the information they provide about themselves.

e.	For the entertainment of the users, Miss uses animators and operators as *professional chat partners that are not marked separately in the system. This service is provided in the highest quality. No real meetings are possible with these operators. Users can only send them messages within the portal.

Miss is not responsible or liable for the terms or actions of such third parties.
16. Amendment of the General Terms and Conditions
Miss reserves the right to amend these General Terms and Conditions at any time, insofar as this does not affect essential provisions of the contractual relationship and it is necessary in order to adapt to developments which were not foreseeable for Miss at the time of conclusion of the contract and the non-observance of which would noticeably disturb the balance of the contractual relationship. Essential provisions are, in particular, those relating to the type and scope of the agreed Services as well as the term, including the provisions on termination. Miss is entitled to make changes to close any gaps in the contract, in particular due to legal changes and changes in case law.
17. Liability of Miss
a.	Miss assumes no responsibility or liability for the accuracy and security of the data and content published or transmitted by other Users.

Although this is not permitted, Users may enter incorrect or illegal information and content or use Miss's Services for inappropriate or illegal purposes.
b.	Miss provides an IT service with access to the database and does not guarantee success. As Miss has no influence on the transmission of data via the internet outside its own IT infrastructure, and due to the characteristics and uncertainties of the internet, Miss cannot accept any liability for such external data losses and/or errors in data transmission. Miss is not liable for any failure of the offer which is beyond its control (e.g. due to force majeure or technical malfunctions of the internet).
c.	Miss assumes no liability for the misuse of information provided by the User to third parties. Miss is also not liable for the unauthorised access of third parties to the personal data of Users (for example through unauthorised access to the central database), unless Miss has deliberately or grossly negligently made the unauthorised access by third parties possible.
d.	Miss is only liable - except in the case of breach of essential contractual obligations, in the case of injury to life, body or health or in the case of claims arising from the Product Liability Act - for intent and gross negligence. Essential contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment is necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract.
e.	In the event of a minor negligent breach of an obligation which is essential for achieving the purpose of the contract (cardinal obligation), Miss's liability shall be limited in amount to the damage which is foreseeable and typical for the type of activity in question.
f.	The above limitation of liability also applies to the personal liability of Miss's employees, representatives and agents.
18. Rights
a.	The User grants Miss a non-exclusive, transferable, geographically unlimited and temporally limited right of use to the contents created or uploaded by them on the database, including pictures, texts and videos.
b.	The User assures that the contents posted or created by them and their use do not infringe the rights of third parties, in particular copyrights or other property rights.
19. Data Protection
Miss collects, processes and uses personal data of the User as described in these Terms and Conditions and in the Privacy Policy. The storage of personal data is governed by the statutory provisions.
20. Cancellation Instruction

In order to exercise the right of cancellation, the User must inform us (Miss miss.refrain@gmail.com) by means of an unambiguous statement (e.g. a letter or e-mail sent by post) of their decision to cancel this contract. In order to comply with the withdrawal period, it is sufficient for them to send notification of the exercise of the right of cancellation before this cancellation period expires.
b.	Consequences of Cancellation
If the User cancels this Agreement, we shall reimburse them all payments we have received from them, including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the User having chosen a method of delivery other than the low-cost standard delivery offered by us) without undue delay and at the latest within fourteen days of the date on which we received notification of the User's cancellation of this Agreement. We shall use the same means of payment for this reimbursement as they used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with them; in no event shall they be charged for this reimbursement.
If the User has requested that the Service commence during the cancellation period, the User shall pay us a reasonable amount equal to the proportion of the Services already provided up to the time when the User notifies us of the exercise of the right of cancellation with respect to this Agreement in relation to the total scope of the Services provided for in the Agreement.
